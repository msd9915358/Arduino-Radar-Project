# Arduino Radar Project

## Overview:
This Arduino project detects and measure distance from the objects. Also, it makes beep sound when it detects an object and frequency of beep sound increases as the as the object comes closer. It is inspired by Dejan with slight chnages in it.
It is made with simple materials which are easily available in the market and easy on pockets as well.

## Materials required:
1. Arduino Board

## Purpose:
In this Arduino Project is an Ultrasonic Sensor for detecting the objects, a small hobbyist Servo Motor for rotating the sensor and an Arduino Board for controlling them.

## Repository Contents-
### Circuit Schemetics: 
It is made by using fritzing software
